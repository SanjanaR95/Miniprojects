This project implements an ARIMA model for time series forecasting to predict future trends based on historical data.
The focus is on exploring stationarity, autocorrelation, and differencing for accurate model fitting.
Includes parameter tuning (p, d, q) and model evaluation using standard statistical metrics.
Libraries: pandas, NumPy, statsmodels, matplotlib
Result: Delivers consistent and explainable time-based predictions for numerical datasets.
